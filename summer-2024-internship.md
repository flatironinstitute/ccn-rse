# Neuroscience Software Summer Internship

Come work with us on an open source neuroscience software project in Manhattan for a summer! The [data science team[ at the Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Neuroscience is looking for paid interns for summer 2024. Interns will spend 11 weeks living and working in New York City.

## What would you work on?
The specific project you will work on will be determined in close consultation with your mentor, a members of the [data science] team. This will involve finding a good fit between your interests/background and the package's objectives and roadmap (check out their GitHub repos, linked below, to get a sense of the range of possibilities). It is okay if you are not sure exactly what you want to work on before you start your internship, and do not expect applicants to have experience with the packages before applying. 

## Software packages
The four software packages that are currently in development at CCN are: 

### Nemos
nemos (Neural Models: https://github.com/flatironinstitute/nemos), maintained by Eduardo Balzani, is a statistical modeling framework for neurophysiology data. 

### Plenoptic
Plenoptic (https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/plenoptic), maintained by Billy Broderick, is a library for model-based visual and auditory stimulus synthesis. 

### Pynapple
Pynapple (Python Neural Analysis Package: https://github.com/pynapple-org/pynapple), maintained by Guillaume Viejo, is a library for neurophysiological time series data analysis and visualization. 

### Caiman
CaImAn (Calcium Imaging Analysis: https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn), maintained by Eric Thomson, provides a platform for analyzing calcium and voltage imaging data. 

## What types of background are we looking for?
We are looking for interns who have experience in one or more of: 
- Scientific computing in Python (e.g., matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.).
- Open-source software development (e.g., git, pull request workflow, writing documentation, etc.).
- The relevant neuroscience domain (e.g., calcium image analysis, fitting models to neuroscience data) with *some* programming background.

We *do not* expect you to already be an expert in both neuroscience and software development! If the internship sounds exciting to you, and you are worried about your qualifications, we recommend that you apply. One of the goals of the internship is to help people learn to contribute to open-source projects. We don't expect you to already be an expert. 

## Anything else I should know?
- The application to work with the [data science] team is part of the broader CCN intern application. If you specifically want to work with the [data science] team, mention that in your application, as well as one or two packages from the above list that you would be interested in working on, and why.
- If you have a GitHub, GitLab, or similar profile, please include it in your application. If you have a specific project or two that is particularly relevant, please include a link to those as well.

## Fine print
Elibigle to current students at Bachelor's level or above. Applications will be accepted starting December 1, 2023. You will be paid $X and housing and meals will be provided. We especially encourage applications from underrepresented populations in the open-source community.
