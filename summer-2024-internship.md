# Neuroscience Software Summer Internship

Alternative: Come work with us on an open source neuroscience software project in Manhattan for a summer! The data science team (NAME TO CHANGE) at the Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Neuroscience is looking for paid interns for summer 2024. Interns will spend 11 weeks living and working in New York City.

For 11 weeks, interns will work with a PhD mentor in the Center for Computational Neuroscience (CCN) on an open source software project. They will get paid to live and work in New York City, socialize with other interns, and work on a neuroscience-related software project at the Flatiron Center for Computational Neuroscience. If this sounds like fun, then please keep reading!

## What would you work on?
The specific project you will work on will be determined in close consultation with your mentor, one of the members of CCN's NAME team. It will based on finding an optimal fit between your interests/background and the package's objectives/roadmap (check out their GitHub repos, linked below, to get a sense for what these are). It is okay if you are not sure exactly what you want to work on before you start your internship! We expect most applicants will not have interacted with any of the following packages.

## Software packages
The four software packages that are currently in development at CCN are: 

### Nemos
nemos (Neural Models: https://github.com/flatironinstitute/nemos), maintained by Eduardo Balzani, is a statistical modeling framework for neurophysiology data. 

### Plenoptic
Plenoptic (https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/plenoptic), maintained by Billy Broderick, is a library for model-based visual and auditory stimulus synthesis. 

### Pynapple
Pynapple (Python Neural Analysis Package: https://github.com/pynapple-org/pynapple), maintained by Guillaume Viejo, is a library for neurophysiological time series data analysis and visualization. 

### Caiman
CaImAn (Calcium Imaging Analysis: https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn), maintained by Eric Thomson, provides a platform for analyzing calcium and voltage imaging data. 

## What types of background are we looking for?

We are looking for interns who have experience in one or more of: scientific python (e.g., numpy, scikit-learn, pytorch), open-source software development (e.g., git, pull request workflow, writing documentation, etc.), or the relevant neuroscience domain (e.g., calcium image analysis, fitting models to neuroscience data). We *do not* expect you to already be an expert in both neuroscience and software development!

## Anything else I should know?

- The application to work with the NAME team is part of the broader CCN intern application. If you specifically want to work with us, mention that in your application, as well as one or two packages from the above list that you'd be interested in working on, and why.
- If you have a GitHub, GitLab, or similar profile, please include it in your application. If you have a specific project or two that is particularly relevant, link those as well.

## Fine print
Elibigle to current students at Bachelor's level or above, with applications open on December 1, 2023. You will be paid $X and housing and meals will be provided. We especially encourage applications from underrepresented populations in the  open-source community.
