Billy Broderick received his Ph.D. from NYU's Center for Neural Science, where he was advised by Eero Simoncelli and Jon Winawer. During his Ph.D., he studied how vision changes across the visual field using fMRI, psychophysics, and computational models. Before that, he worked as a research assistant at Duke University, spent a year at South China Normal University in Guangzhou, China as a [Luce Scholar](http://www.hluce.org/lsprogram.aspx), and got his B.A. in neuroscience and mathematics at Oberlin College
