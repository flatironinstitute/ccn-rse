Edoardo is the one of the principal developers of Nemos, a package for statistical modeling of neural activity.  He earned his Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the Italian Institute of Technology in Genova, under the guidance of Valter Tucci. Before joining the Flatiron institute as a data scientist, he worked as a postdoc in Cristina Savin's lab at NYU's Center for Neural Science where he developed statistical methods for the analysis of neural spike trains during naturalistic behavior.
