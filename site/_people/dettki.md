Hanna is a Master’s student in psychology at New York University and in computer science at the University of Tuebingen, Germany. She’s interested in both human and artificial intelligence and how to bridge the gap between the two. Specifically, she is interested in using computational methods to model and better understand the complexities of our mind, brain, and behavior. Prior to starting her Master’s degree at NYU on a Fulbright scholarship, she studied cognitive and computer science at the National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan, Hong Kong University, and the University of Tuebingen, where she received her B.Sc.
