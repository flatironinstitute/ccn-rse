Kipp is currently undertaking a PhD within the Computational Neuroscience Unit at the University of Bristol, where he is supervised by Cian O'Donnell, Matt W. Jones, and Nathan Lepora. His research examines spatial and navigational representations in the hippocampus, and how and why these representations change over time. At Flatiron, Kipp is developing signal processing tools for pynapple to expand it's utility for analysis of local field potential data.
