plenoptic is a python library for model-based synthesis of perceptual stimuli. The generated stimuli enable interpretation of model properties through examination of features that are enhanced, suppressed, or descarded. More importantly, they can facilitate the scientific proceess, through use in perceptual or neural experiments aimed at validating/falsifying model predictions.
