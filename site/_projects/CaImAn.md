CaImAn provides a full pipeline for analyzing single-cell optical physiology data -- both calcium and voltage imaging data. Given raw data, CaImAn provides algorithms for motion-correction and the extraction of the locations of neural components and their corresponding calcium/voltage traces. It also includes extensive tools for visualizing data, results, and quality control.
