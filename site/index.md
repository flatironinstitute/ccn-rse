# About

The NeuroRSE group at Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Neuroscience builds and maintains open source software for computational and systems neuroscience. We intend to create solid packages that can be relied and built upon, rather than chasing cutting-edge research.

# Our projects

All of our projects are open-source python packages. We are always happy to get external contributors and happy to help new users get started!

## [CaImAn](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn)

Recent advances in calcium imaging acquisition techniques are creating datasets of the order of Terabytes/week. Memory and computationally efficient algorithms are required to analyze in reasonable amount of time terabytes of data. This project implements a set of essential methods required in the calcium imaging movies analysis pipeline. Fast and scalable algorithms are implemented for motion correction, movie manipulation, and source and spike extraction. CaImAn also contains some routines for the analyisis of behavior from video cameras. In summary, CaImAn provides a general purpose tool to handle large movies, with special emphasis on tools for two-photon and one-photon calcium imaging and behavioral datasets.

## [nemos](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/nemos)

A statistical modeling framework for systems neuroscience. Nemos currently focuses on convex optimization and the generalized linear model (GLM).

## [plenoptic](https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/plenoptic/)

plenoptic is a python library for model-based synthesis of perceptual stimuli. The generated stimuli enable interpretation of model properties through examination of features that are enhanced, suppressed, or descarded. More importantly, they can facilitate the scientific proceess, through use in perceptual or neural experiments aimed at validating/falsifying model predictions.

## [pynapple](https://pynapple-org.github.io/pynapple/)

pynapple is a light-weight python library for neurophysiological data analysis. The goal is to offer a versatile set of tools to study typical data in the field, i.e. time series (spike times, behavioral events, etc.) and time intervals (trials, brain states, etc.). It also provides users with generic functions for neuroscience such as tuning curves and cross-correlograms.

## [CCN Template](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/ccn-template/)

The CCN Template repo is not an actual python package, but an attempt to make and document all the many decisions that go into writing open-source python packages: structure, packaging, documentation, testing, etc. This is largely intended for our use, but hope it can serve as a resource for the broader community!

## Edoardo Balzani
## [Billy Broderick](https://wfbroderick.com)

Billy Broderick received his Ph.D. from NYU's Center for Neural Science, where he was advised by Eero Simoncelli and Jon Winawer. During his Ph.D., he studied how vision changes across the visual field using fMRI, psychophysics, and computational models. Before that, he worked as a research assistant at Duke University, spent a year at South China Normal University in Guangzhou, China as a [Luce Scholar](http://www.hluce.org/lsprogram.aspx), and got his B.A. in neuroscience and mathematics at Oberlin College


## Eric Thomson
## [Guillaume Viejo](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/guillaume-viejo/)

Guillaume Viejo joined the Center for Computational Neuroscience as a data scientist, where he focuses on developing software for analyzing neurophysiological data. He holds a Ph.D. in computational neuroscience from the Institute of Intelligent Systems and Robotics at the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, France. After completing his doctorate, Guillaume worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Montreal Neurological Institute, where he studied the head-direction system (also known as the brainâ€™s compass) in rodents.
