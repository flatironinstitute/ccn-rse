# About

The NeuroRSE group at Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Neuroscience builds and maintains open source software for computational and systems neuroscience. We intend to create solid packages that can be relied and built upon, rather than chasing cutting-edge research.

**What does RSE mean?** A "research software engineer", which is defined by the [US-RSE professional organization](https://us-rse.org/about/what-is-an-rse/) as someone "who regularly use expertise in programming to advance research".

## [Edoardo Balzani](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/edoardo-balzani/)
<img src="./assets/edoardo.jpg" align="right" style="padding:0px 0px 0px 15px" width="100"/>
Edoardo is the one of the principal developers of Nemos, a package for statistical modeling of neural activity.  He earned his Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the Italian Institute of Technology in Genova, under the guidance of Valter Tucci. Before joining the Flatiron institute as a data scientist, he worked as a postdoc in Cristina Savin's lab at NYU's Center for Neural Science where he developed statistical methods for the analysis of neural spike trains during naturalistic behavior.

## [Billy Broderick](https://wfbroderick.com)
<img src="./assets/billy.jpg" align="right" style="padding:0px 0px 0px 15px" width="100"/>
Billy Broderick received his Ph.D. from NYU's Center for Neural Science, where he was advised by Eero Simoncelli and Jon Winawer. During his Ph.D., he studied how vision changes across the visual field using fMRI, psychophysics, and computational models. Before that, he worked as a research assistant at Duke University, spent a year at South China Normal University in Guangzhou, China as a [Luce Scholar](http://www.hluce.org/lsprogram.aspx), and got his B.A. in neuroscience and mathematics at Oberlin College

## [Eric Thomson](https://ericthomson.net)
<img src="./assets/eric.jpg" align="right" style="padding:0px 0px 0px 15px" width="100"/>
Eric helps maintain CaImAn, the calcium imaging analysis platform. His main goal is to build software that works well and is accessible to experimentalists. He received his PhD in neuroscience from UCSD before working as a postdoc at Duke University with Miguel Nicolelis on sensory prosthetic systems. He then worked in  computational optics with Roarke Horstmeyer and Eva Naumann, helping to develop a multi-camera microscope system. Before coming to Flatiron, Eric was a data scientist at NIH/NIEHS, working with multiple neuroscience labs to analyze calcium imaging and electrophysiology data. 



## [Guillaume Viejo](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/guillaume-viejo/)
<img src="./assets/guillaume.jpg" align="right" style="padding:0px 0px 0px 15px" width="100"/>
Guillaume Viejo joined the Center for Computational Neuroscience as a data scientist, where he focuses on developing software for analyzing neurophysiological data. He holds a Ph.D. in computational neuroscience from the Institute of Intelligent Systems and Robotics at the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, France. After completing his doctorate, Guillaume worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Montreal Neurological Institute, where he studied the head-direction system (also known as the brainâ€™s compass) in rodents.
