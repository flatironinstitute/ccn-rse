# About

The NeuroRSE group at Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Neuroscience builds and maintains open source software for computational and systems neuroscience. We intend to create solid packages that can be relied and built upon, rather than chasing cutting-edge research.

# Our Projects

All of our projects are open-source python packages. We are always happy to get external contributors and happy to help new users get started!

## Edoardo Balzani

## [Billy Broderick](https://wfbroderick.com)

Billy Broderick received his Ph.D. from NYU's Center for Neural Science, where he was advised by Eero Simoncelli and Jon Winawer. During his Ph.D., he studied how vision changes across the visual field using fMRI, psychophysics, and computational models. Before that, he worked as a research assistant at Duke University, spent a year at South China Normal University in Guangzhou, China as a [Luce Scholar](http://www.hluce.org/lsprogram.aspx), and got his B.A. in neuroscience and mathematics at Oberlin College

## [Guillaume Viejo](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/guillaume-viejo/)

Guillaume Viejo joined the Center for Computational Neuroscience as a data scientist, where he focuses on developing software for analyzing neurophysiological data. He holds a Ph.D. in computational neuroscience from the Institute of Intelligent Systems and Robotics at the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, France. After completing his doctorate, Guillaume worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Montreal Neurological Institute, where he studied the head-direction system (also known as the brainâ€™s compass) in rodents.
