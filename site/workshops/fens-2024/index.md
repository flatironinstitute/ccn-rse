# Flatiron CCN Software Workshop at FENS 2024

We are excited to see everyone at the Flatiron Center for Computational Neuroscience FENS Satellite event on using open source packages to analyze and visualize neural data! You should have received an email with logistical information, including the schedule and link to the slack channel where we will be communicating the workshop. If you did not receive this email, please let us know!

Over the course of this two-day workshop, we will walk you through the notebooks included on this site in order to demonstrate how to use pynapple, fastplotlib, and NeMoS to analyze and visualize your data.

This website contains links to the presentations for the workshop, as well as to other useful information.

## Useful links

- [Workshop schedule](https://indd.adobe.com/view/b2801079-d3e8-4dfb-80bd-92ca5806bc6a)
- [Github site](https://flatironinstitute.github.io/ccn-software-fens-2024/)
- Websites for the packages used in this workshop:
    - pynapple: [documentation](https://pynapple-org.github.io/pynapple/), [github repo](https://github.com/pynapple-org/pynapple)
    - fastplotlib: [documentation](https://fastplotlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [github repo](https://github.com/fastplotlib/fastplotlib)
    - NeMoS: [documentation](https://nemos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [github repo](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/nemos)
- We strongly recommend the use of the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard for structuring your data; this will make the use of our packages (and others!) much easier, both in and out of the workshop. More info can be found at the following links:
    - [PyNWB](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    - Tools for converting data into NWB: [NeuroConv](https://neuroconv.readthedocs.io/en/main/) (python library) and [NWB GUIDE](https://nwb-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (GUI)
    - [NWB Helpdesk](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/helpdesk/discussions), to get help!

## Setup

Before the workshop begins:
- follow the setup instructions found on the [workshop github site](https://flatironinstitute.github.io/ccn-software-fens-2024/)
- if you plan on analyzing some of your own data, please convert your data to NWB. See the links above for some tools to help you do so.
