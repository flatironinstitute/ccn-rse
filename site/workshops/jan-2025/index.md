# Flatiron CCN Software Workshop, January 2025

The Flatiron Center for Computational Neuroscience is excited to announce a workshop on using open source packages to analyze neural data in January 2025!

Over the course of this two-day workshop, we will walk you through notebooks in order to demonstrate how to use pynapple and NeMoS to analyze and visualize neural data.

## Intended audience

- This workshop is intended for grad students and postdocs who are experimentalists in systems neuroscience, and who gather and analyze their own electrophysiology or calcium imaging data.
- In order to make best use of the limited space in the workshop, we will prioritize accepting one applicant per lab.
- Applicants are expected to have basic familiarity with python and standard scientific python libraries (e.g., numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn). They should be able to write their own functions to analyze and visualize data. They are not expected to familiar with either pynapple or NeMoS.

## Important dates

- Applications opens October 1
- Applications are due November 1
- Applicants must notify us of their attendance by November 11
- Workshop: January 29 to 31, 2025

## Logistics

- The workshop will take place at the Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Neuroscience in midtown Manhattan.
- We will accept approximately 30 attendees.
- This workshop is intended for folks who are located within a two-hour flight of New York City. (We will host other workshops in other locations!)
- For those not in the New York City area, travel and accomodations will be provided.
- Meals will be provided, including one off-site dinner.

## Workshop contents

Over the course of this workshop, attendees will learn how to use pynapple and NeMoS to explore and analyze electrophysiogical data, making use of real datasets. Users will:
- learn how to use pynapple to represent neural data, taking advantage of the shared time axis to perform common manipulations.
- use pynapple to compute tuning curves and correlograms.
- use NeMoS to fit generalized linear models to spiking data, investigating functional connectivity and comparing among possible models.

To get a sense of the material we will cover, see our [workshop from FENS 2024](../fens-2024).
